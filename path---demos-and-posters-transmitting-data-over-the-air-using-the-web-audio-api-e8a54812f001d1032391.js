It allows web applications to send and receive data using the systemâ€™s audio peripherals, enabling the browser to communicate with other devices within hearing range.\n\nThe Web Audio/Media Stream API is used to capture incoming audio data from the microphone and to send output data to the speakers. The audio data is processed by high-performance C code, compiled into a WebAssembly binary.\n\nThis paper describes the context of the work, summarises its system architecture and performance metrics, and suggests a few ways that it can be used in practical scenarios.",authors:[{link:"http://chirp.io/",name:"Joe Todd"},{link:"http://chirp.io/",name:"Adib Mehrabi"},{link:"http://chirp.io/",name:"Daniel Jones"}],slug:"transmitting-data-over-the-air-using-the-web-audio-api",title:"Transmitting Data Over The Air Using the Web Audio API",type:"demo"}}}});
