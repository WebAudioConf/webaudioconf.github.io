It allows the same concise C++ code to be used to create desktop and web-based versions of a software musical instrument or audio effect, including audio signal processing and user interface elements. This new version of the framework has been updated to increase its flexibility so that alternative drawing APIs, plug-in APIs and platform APIs can be supported easily. We have added support for the distributed models used in recent audio plug-in formats, as well as new graphics capabilities. The codebase has also been substantially modernised.
