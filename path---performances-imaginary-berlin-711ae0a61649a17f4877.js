Influenced by the collaborative music piece Imaginary Landscape No. 4 (1951) by John Cage, 12 audio streams from Berlin-inspired radio stations will be emitted from a central laptop connected to a PA system. The audience will be able to pick one audio stream at any time by moving horizontally their mobile phones, and control the volume of the selected audio stream by moving vertically their mobile phones. The original Cage's piece was designed for 12 pairs of performers, here the emphasis remains in the group participation and creation of a larger musical network by the potential generation of delays and localized sounds within the same space.",authors:[{link:"http://annaxambo.me/",name:"Anna Xamb√≥"}],slug:"imaginary-berlin",title:"Imaginary Berlin",type:"performance"}}}});
