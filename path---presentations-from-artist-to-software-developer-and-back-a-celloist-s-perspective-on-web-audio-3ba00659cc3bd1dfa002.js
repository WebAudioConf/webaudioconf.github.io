As a coding artist, I try to mould the Web Audio API into actionable music tools. Therefore, I started to translate the Tone.js Framework into a Ruby gem. \n\n2. I try to find a balance between the coding part and my ‘normal’ music workflow, i.e. sketching ideas with the intuitive user interface of professional DAW software, in my case: Ableton Live. Therefore I need to find an easy way to transfer musical content between the Ableton and the Web Audio environments. \n\n3. How can I create music with a 'story' and emotional compact in the context of generative and interactive composing techniques?",authors:[{link:"http://hroski.com/",name:"Hilke Ros"}],slug:"from-artist-to-software-developer-and-back-a-celloist-s-perspective-on-web-audio",title:"From artist to software developer and back.
