It was conceived in response to several issues raised during the development of WebX0X Version 2:\n\n1. User interface features represented the majority of the development effort.\n2. User interface design and development was a significant barrier to the introduction of new features.\n3. Rendering times associated with large DOM hierarchies created non-trivial performance problems that were difficult and time consuming to resolve.\n\nThe recent rise of live coding as a means of performing and recording electronic music suggested that these issues could be resolved by replacing traditional user interfaces with code.\n\nlcdm uses a custom syntax to describe rhythmic patterns, and provides an integrated sampler and drum sample library.",authors:[{link:"https://irritantcreative.ca/",name:"Tony Wallace"}],slug:"live-coding-drum-machine",title:"Live Coding Drum Machine",type:"demo"}}}});
